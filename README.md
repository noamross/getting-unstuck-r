Getting Unstuck. 
===============

This repository will contain a lesson for "getting unstuck" in computer programming for 
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) lessons.  

Right now it's just a clone of the SWC [lesson template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template).  Raw material
is in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5k756NV-w4j7k3OHbs_NSEnx4Ro9pptJN8obDVSCk/edit), as well
as the [zero-dependency-problems](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems) repository, where I am collecting
examples of novice problems for examples, exercises, and [reverse instructional design](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/04-design.html)
